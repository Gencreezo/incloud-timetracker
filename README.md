# Summary

It took me more than the 8 available hours to complete this task and it is still unfinished. 
First I tried to make the API with GraphQl, I ran into some trouble and I couldn't make it work,
I was a little disappointed about that. But I didn't wanna waste more time on it, so I used REST instead, because I have more experience in that. 
I used Firebase as my database for the same reasons, which I regret a little. I do think it's a good database to quickly get an app running, but I didn't think about the service account, which you need to use the app.
For not having too much experience in React, I do think I made a decent job. I tried to do some css at the end but couldn't finish it as time ran out.

With more time I would implement the missing features: pagination, search
And make everything pretty.

Overall I enjoyed the task, it was challenging but in a fun way.
